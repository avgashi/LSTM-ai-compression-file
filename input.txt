Reasons I Can't Fix It Directly:

Script Content: The syntax error likely involves a mismatch between loop statements (for, while) or conditional statements (if) and their corresponding do and done keywords. The specific fix depends on the logic flow within your script.
Custom Logic: The tg script might be performing custom actions that I'm unaware of, so I can't assume the correct structure without seeing it.
How to Get the Fixed Code

Share the Relevant Code: Please paste the portion of your tg script around line 38, including maybe 10-15 lines above and below it. This will give me the context to understand the potential syntax issue.

Anonymize if Needed: If your script contains sensitive information, feel free to replace specific file paths, variable names, or data with generic placeholders, as long as the overall logic structure remains intact.

How I'll Approach the Fix

Once you provide the code snippet, I'll do the following:

Analyze the Structure: I'll examine the code snippet you share and identify any mismatched loops or if blocks.
Suggest a Fix: I'll provide a corrected version of the code snippet, explaining the reason for the change.
Explain the Error: I'll guide you about the general nature of the "syntax error near unexpected token 'done'" error so you can avoid similar issues in the future.
